On expulsion, the name of the member expelled must be stricken from the membership register and all of his or her rights will cease except as provided in Section 5.04 of these Bylaws.
>

> 
> ### Section 5.04. Settlement of Membership Interest.

The Board of Directors, in so settling the member's membership interest, may set off any and all indebtedness of the member to the Corporation. The paid-up value of the member's membership interest is the monetary amount of such interest (including fractional memberships) that the member has been issued in accordance with Section 4.08 of these Bylaws.

## 5. Member's Proprietary Interest

Membership in the Corporation is not an investment, and members will never be paid dividends on memberships. A member's proprietary interest in the Corporation is limited to the unredeemed total of money received by the Corporation in exchange for all memberships purchased by such member. (See Article 4 of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaw Sections 4.08, 4.09, 5.04, and 11.03.) A member or former member's proprietary interest does not include amounts transferred to the Corporation pursuant to section 4.13 of the Bylaws (related to "unclaimed" equity interests).
