Title: Abuse Policy

IO Cooperative is periodically sent reports of [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_abuse),
for example a report of an IO Cooperative member's IP address attempting to gain
unauthorized access to another system out on the internet.

When IO Cooperative receives an abuse report indicating that a member's IP
address is the origin of abuse IO Cooperative will notify the member. The
notification will indicate that the member has 48 hours to respond to the
report, illustrating how the abuse has been stopped or how the report was
inaccurate. If the member has not responded or resolved the abuse within that
time period their IP address will be blocked from inbound and outbound network
access.

If IO Cooperative deems that the reported abuse is affecting service 
availability for other cooperative members, the IP address will be immediately
blocked and the member will be notified of the abuse and the block.

Once the abuse is resolved the member's IP address may be unblocked. IO 
Cooperative will [terminate membership](https://iocoop.org/policies/bylaws#section-503-expulsion)
of any member who repeatedly allows abuse to originate from their IP address or
if the IO Cooperative board deems the abuse to be intentional.
