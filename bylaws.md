If the adjournment is for more than forty-five (45) days or if a new record date is fixed, a notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

The ballots must be distributed in a manner consistent with the provisions of Sections 6.05, 6.17(b), and 6.19 of these Bylaws.

### Section 6.15. Contents of Written or Electronic Ballot Used at Meetings.

The form must also provide that whenever the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any matter, the vote will be cast in accordance with that choice.

(c) A written or electronic ballot cannot be revoked. Approval by written or electronic ballot will be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

Ballots must be solicited in a manner consistent with Sections 6.05, 6.17(b), and 6.19 of these Bylaws.

Ballots other than for the election of Directors must state the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure.

### Section 6.19. Withholding Vote.

(b) The rights set forth in Subsection (a) of this Bylaw section may be exercised by any member or members possessing five percent (5%) or more of the voting power for a purpose reasonably related to the members' interest as members. The Corporation may deny access to the membership list where it reasonably believes that the information therein will be used for another purpose or where the Corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to Section 10.03(c) of these Bylaws.

(c) The Corporation may within ten (10) days after receiving a demand, deliver a written offer of an alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. An alternative method that reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in a demand made pursuant to Section 10.03(a) of these Bylaws will be a reasonable alternative, unless the Corporation fails to do the things that it offered to do within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer. Any rejection of the offer must be in writing and indicate the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

## Article XI. Surplus Allocations and Distributions

### Section 11.01. Fiscal Year.

The fiscal year of the Corporation will end at the close of the business day on the last day of the month of June of each year.

### Section 11.02. Surplus and Patronage Defined.

(a) "Surplus" is defined as the excess of revenues and gains over expenses and losses for a fiscal year. Such surplus will be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and must be computed without regard to any patronage refunds, capital allocations, dividends, or income taxes.

(b) "Patronage" is defined as payment of charges for services provided by the Corporation.

### Section 11.03. Annual Allocations and Distributions of Surplus.

(a) Before any patronage refunds are distributed for each fiscal year, any surplus should first be allocated to any deficit in the accounting of "retained earnings" of the Corporation.

(b) The Directors may then uniformly distribute all the remaining surplus attributed to patronage of the members of the Corporation to such members as described in the following paragraphs of this subsection of these Bylaws. For the purposes of this subsection of the Bylaws, the remaining patronage surplus must be computed consistent with Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code, related Treasury Regulations, and related court and other relevant interpretations.

   1. Any remaining patronage surplus attributed to the members and to be distributed to them must be the total remaining patronage surplus attributed to both member and nonmember business (reduced by allocations to eliminate a deficit in retained earnings) multiplied by the ratio of member patronage to total patronage.

   2. A member is entitled to a patronage refund, if such is distributed, in the amount of the remaining patronage surplus, as determined by Paragraph (1) of this subsection of these Bylaws, multiplied by the ratio of such member's patronage with the Corporation to the patronage of all members with the Corporation.

(c) If a member owns three hundred dollars ($300.00) or more in memberships as of the end of the fiscal year for which patronage refunds are to be paid or allocated, such member must receive all of her or his patronage refunds in cash. The three hundred dollar ($300.00) amount will be known as a member's "Fair Share."

(d) Each person who becomes a member of this Corporation consents to include in his or her gross income for federal income tax purposes the amount of any patronage refund paid to him or her by this Corporation in money or by written notice of allocation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), except to the extent that such a patronage refund is not income to the member because (i) it is attributable to the purchase of personal, living, or family items, or (ii) it should properly be treated as an adjustment to the tax basis of property previously purchased. The term "patronage refund," as used herein, will have the same meaning as the term "patronage dividend," as used in the Internal Revenue Code.

(e) For the purpose of allocating and distributing any annual surplus, the entire operations of the Corporation must be considered as a unit; provided that by resolution of the Board of Directors, the Corporation may distribute patronage refunds on the basis of the business transacted by each of the departments or divisions into which the operations of the Corporation may be divided by the Board for the purpose of such allocation.

## Article XII. Bylaw Changes

### Section 12.01. Bylaw Changes by the Board.

The Bylaws may be adopted, amended, or repealed by the Board of Directors unless the action would:

(a) materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of members as to voting, dissolution, redemption transfer, distributions, patronage distributions, patronage, property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

(b) increase or decrease the number of members or memberships authorized in total or for any class;

(c) effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the memberships;

(d) authorize a new class of memberships;

(e) change the number of Directors or establish a variable number of Directors;

(f) extend the term of a Director beyond that for which the Director was elected or increase the terms of the Directors;

(g) allow all or any portion of the Directors to hold office by virtue of designation or selection rather than by election by the members: and

(h) allow the Board to fill vacancies occurring in the Board by reason of the removal of Directors.

### Section 12.02. Bylaw Changes by the Members.

Where the Board of Directors is denied the right to adopt, amend, or repeal these Bylaws pursuant to Section 12.01 of these Bylaws, these Bylaws may be adopted, amended, or repealed by approval of the members.

## Article XIII. Indemnification

### Section 13.01. Indemnification of Agents

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation will indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Coop Law Section 12377(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. "Expenses," as used in this bylaw, will have the same meaning as in that section of the Coop Law.

(b) On written request to the Board of Directors by any person seeking indemnification under Coop Law Section 12377(b) or Section 12377(c), the Board must promptly decide, per the procedure in Coop Law Section 12377(e), whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the corresponding section has been met and, if so, the Board will authorize indemnification.

(c) If the Board of Directors cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the Board must promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members must determine under Coop Law Section 12377(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting will authorize indemnification.
